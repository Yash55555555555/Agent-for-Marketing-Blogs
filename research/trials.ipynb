An unpaid campaign is when \\nyou gift your inÔ¨Çuencer one of your products so that they can craft \\na post about it on their social media pages. Work out a deal with \\nthem based off what works best for the both of you. Does a one-\\ntime product exchange work for the two of you? What about a \\nmonthly product exchange for a few posts?
